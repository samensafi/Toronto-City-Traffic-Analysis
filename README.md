# Toronto City Traffic Analysis

This project analyzes the traffic volume data in Toronto in order to identify patterns/trends in car, truck, and pedestrian movement by direction.

## Data

The data used here is from the [City of Toronto Open Data Portal](https://open.toronto.ca/). It includes traffic counts for different types of vehicles and pedestrians at various intersections.

### How to Get the Data

Step 1- Go to [Traffic Volumes at Intersections for All Modes](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/traffic-volumes-at-intersections-for-all-modes/) and click on Download Data.


Step 2- Download these two files:
   - **Locations** (`locations.csv`)
   - **Raw Data** (`raw-data-2020-2029.csv`)

## Running the Analysis 

The main analysis code is in `analysis.R` and it covers loading, cleaning, summarizing, and visualizing of the traffic data.
